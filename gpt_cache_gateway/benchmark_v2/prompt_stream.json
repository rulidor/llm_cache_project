Notice that sqrt(18) = sqrt(2*9) = sqrt(2)sqrt(9) = 3sqrt(2), so sqrt(18) can be expressed in terms of sqrt(2), which means that including sqrt(18) in the field doesn't actually increase the degree of the extension.\nThus, the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) is the same as the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).\nFor the degree of a simple extension field Q(a, b) over Q, we want to find the least common multiple (lcm) of the degrees of the extension fields Q(a) over Q and Q(b) over Q.\nsqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are both irrational numbers, and the minimal polynomials that they are roots of are both quadratic (x^2 - 2 and x^2 - 3, respectively). Thus, the extension fields Q(sqrt(2)) and Q(sqrt(3)) are both of degree 2 over Q.\nTherefore, the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) has degree lcm(2, 2) = 2 * 2 = 4 over Q. The square root of 18 does not increase the degree of the field, as explained above.\nSo, the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) also has degree 4 over Q.\nAnswer key: \"B\"<end>\n\n<start>Question: NAME_1 is five years older than NAME_2, who is twice NAME_3's age at seven.  Calculate NAME_1's age.\nChoices : \"14\", \"7\", \"21\", \"19\"\nPlanning For Answer: Given that NAME_2 is twice NAME_3's age, and NAME_3 is seven years old, NAME_2 would be 2 * 7 = 14 years old. Since NAME_1 is five years older than NAME_2, NAME_1 would be 14 + 5 = 19 years old.\nAnswer key: \"D\"<end>\n\n<start>Question: ['Use the expression below to answer the question. 3 × [(2 × 6 – 5) + (8 ÷ 4)] – 1 What is the value of the expression?']\nChoices: ['9'], ['11'], ['26'], ['32']\nPlanning For Answer: To answer this question",

I want you to Answer the question based on the given Knowledge.\n\nKnowledge:\nKopi luwak, also known as civet coffee, is a coffee that consists of partially digested coffee cherries, which have been eaten and defecated by the Asian palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus). The cherries are fermented as they pass through a civet's intestines, and after being defecated with other fecal matter, they are collected.[1] Asian palm civets are increasingly caught in the wild and traded for this purpose.\n\nKopi luwak is produced mainly on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra, Java, Bali, Sulawesi, and in East Timor. It is also widely gathered in the forest or produced in farms in the islands of the Philippines,[3] where the product is called kape motit in the Cordillera region, kapé alamíd in Tagalog areas, kapé melô or kapé musang in Mindanao, and kahawa kubing in the Sulu Archipelago. 'NAME_1 coffee' is a loose English translation of its Vietnamese name cà phê Chồn.\n\nProducers of the coffee beans argue that the process may improve coffee through two mechanisms: selection, where civets choose to eat only certain cherries; and digestion, where biological or chemical mechanisms in the animals' digestive tracts alter the composition of the coffee cherries.\n\nThe traditional method of collecting feces from wild Asian palm civets has given way to an intensive farming method, in which the palm civets are kept in battery cages and are force-fed the cherries. This method of production has raised ethical concerns about the treatment of civets and the conditions they are made to live in, which include isolation, poor diet, small cages, and a high mortality rate.\n\nAlthough kopi luwak is a form of processing rather than a variety of coffee, it has been called one of the most expensive coffees in the world, with retail prices reaching US$100 per kilogram for farmed beans and US$1,300 per kilogram for wild-collected beans.[7] Another epithet given to it is that it is NAME_2 of coffees.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the cost of Kopi Luwak per kilogram\n\nAnswer:\"\n",

As part of this commitment, today the Departments of Education and Justice filed a legal brief with the Supreme Court explaining our legal authority under the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act to carry out our program of one-time, targeted debt relief. We remain confident in our legal authority to adopt this program that will ensure the financial harms caused by the pandemic don’t drive borrowers into delinquency and default. We are unapologetically committed to helping borrowers recover from the pandemic and providing working families with the breathing room they need to prepare for student loan payments to resume. As previously announced, student loan payments and interests will remain paused until the Supreme Court resolves the case because it would be deeply unfair to ask borrowers to pay debt they wouldn’t have to pay, were it not for meritless lawsuits.”",

As soon as it contacts the soil, worms and other invertebrates begin breaking it down into smaller parts; absorbing nutrients from what they consume and excreting the rest. This first stage of decomposition sets the scene for microbes. The specific microbes present depend on the environment. For example, in grasslands and farm fields there tend to be more bacteria, which excel at breaking down grass and leaves. But in this temperate forest there are more fungi, capable of breaking down complex woody materials. Looking to harvest more food from the apple\\u2019s remains, these microbes release enzymes that trigger a chemical reaction called oxidation.\\nCreate a multiple-choice question based on the transcript, where the correct answer is \\\"C) 25\\\"\\n",

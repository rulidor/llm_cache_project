    "prompt": "\"You are an assistant who answers the question only based on given knowledge as truthfully as possible. I want you to Answer the question based on the given Knowledge.\n\nKnowledge:\nKopi luwak, also known as civet coffee, is a coffee that consists of partially digested coffee cherries, which have been eaten and defecated by the Asian palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus). The cherries are fermented as they pass through a civet's intestines, and after being defecated with other fecal matter, they are collected.[1] Asian palm civets are increasingly caught in the wild and traded for this purpose.\n\nKopi luwak is produced mainly on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra, Java, Bali, Sulawesi, and in East Timor. It is also widely gathered in the forest or produced in farms in the islands of the Philippines,[3] where the product is called kape motit in the Cordillera region, kapé alamíd in Tagalog areas, kapé melô or kapé musang in Mindanao, and kahawa kubing in the Sulu Archipelago. 'NAME_1 coffee' is a loose English translation of its Vietnamese name cà phê Chồn.\n\nProducers of the coffee beans argue that the process may improve coffee through two mechanisms: selection, where civets choose to eat only certain cherries; and digestion, where biological or chemical mechanisms in the animals' digestive tracts alter the composition of the coffee cherries.\n\nThe traditional method of collecting feces from wild Asian palm civets has given way to an intensive farming method, in which the palm civets are kept in battery cages and are force-fed the cherries. This method of production has raised ethical concerns about the treatment of civets and the conditions they are made to live in, which include isolation, poor diet, small cages, and a high mortality rate.\n\nAlthough kopi luwak is a form of processing rather than a variety of coffee, it has been called one of the most expensive coffees in the world, with retail prices reaching US$100 per kilogram for farmed beans and US$1,300 per kilogram for wild-collected beans.[7] Another epithet given to it is that it is NAME_2 of coffees.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the cost of Kopi Luwak per kilogram\n\nAnswer:\"\n"

He was born in La Barre, France on Earth, with a rich ancestral lineage linked to viticulture. He has a largely investigative mind, much like an archaeologist, which fuels his quests throughout the galaxy.\nInformation:    Jean Luc Picard's birth and early life date back about a century ago in the small town of La Barre in France, on Earth. His life's path led him to become the Captain of the Starship Enterprise, one of the Federation's most significant starships, commanding it through numerous interstellar missions.\nInformation:    Scholars of Star Trek: The Next Generation have noted changes in Picard's leadership and personality over time. The Captain we see today has evolved significantly since his initial appearances. Considering the myriad alien species and cultures Picard has encountered, the uniqueness of his Starship's crew, and the numerous anomalies he has navigated, it's evident that his experiences have shaped him. For instance, his relationship with the android Data is particularly fascinating, and the collective threats faced by the Enterprise, such as the Borg, have tested and honed his leadership skills.\nInformation:    For centuries, humanity had no comprehensive understanding of the universe beyond Earth, much like the geocentrists' belief of the Earth at the center of everything. However, figures like Zefram Cochrane and Jonathan Archer developed technological and societal systems that pushed humanity into the age of space exploration, similar to how Nicolaus Copernicus revolutionized our understanding of the Solar System. By the 24th century, when Jean Luc Picard commands the Enterprise, these advancements have allowed for detailed exploration of the galaxy, understanding alien species, their worlds, and civilizations - all governed by the same physical"

Notice that sqrt(18) = sqrt(2*9) = sqrt(2)sqrt(9) = 3sqrt(2), so sqrt(18) can be expressed in terms of sqrt(2), which means that including sqrt(18) in the field doesn't actually increase the degree of the extension.\nThus, the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) is the same as the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).\nFor the degree of a simple extension field Q(a, b) over Q, we want to find the least common multiple (lcm) of the degrees of the extension fields Q(a) over Q and Q(b) over Q.\nsqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are both irrational numbers, and the minimal polynomials that they are roots of are both quadratic (x^2 - 2 and x^2 - 3, respectively). Thus, the extension fields Q(sqrt(2)) and Q(sqrt(3)) are both of degree 2 over Q.\nTherefore, the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) has degree lcm(2, 2) = 2 * 2 = 4 over Q. The square root of 18 does not increase the degree of the field, as explained above.\nSo, the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) also has degree 4 over Q.\nAnswer key: \"B\"<end>\n\n<start>Question: NAME_1 is five years older than NAME_2, who is twice NAME_3's age at seven.

Since NAME_1 is five years older than NAME_2, NAME_1 would be 14 + 5 = 19 years old.\nAnswer key: \"D\"<end>\n\n<start>Question: ['Use the expression below to answer the question. 3 × [(2 × 6 – 5) + (8 ÷ 4)] – 1 What is the value of the expression?']\nChoices: ['9'], ['11'], ['26'], ['32']\nPlanning For Answer: To answer this question"
